On Wasserstein Gaussian Barycenters
==============================

A project on using Optimal Transport to produce ensembles of Gaussian Processes. The idea is that barycenters of conditioned Gaussian Process produced using the wasserstein distance possess certain properties that could be useful to practicioners.
